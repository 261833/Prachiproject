# Introduction
* While designing a circuit, depending on our requirement, certain times odd values of resistance are required in the circuit, values which are not directly available as standard valued resistors. So this utility aims to provide best combinations of standard resistors which can be used.

# Cost and Features
* Will provide series as well as parallel combination of resistors suitable for the required odd value.

# 4W's and 1'H
## Who:
* Circuit designers

## What:
* The task of searching for standard value resistors to combine and yield your required value of resistance becomes complicated and hence it can turn out to be helpful

## When:
* On encountering a odd value resistor requirement while designing circuit

## Where:
* Industries designing circuits, in labs 

## How
* User can just choose the tolerance value required, and enter the required resistance value and the possible combinations would be displayed

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements
